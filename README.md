# **Django Example Apps**
This repository is a collection of Django example I have built using various tutorials and resources. <BR>

**Current Application List**
* Django-Stripe Payment Processing Example (Django 1.8 Python 2.7)  <BR>
     * This application utilizes the Stripe api to process credit card payments, and submit a contact form. Also, it uses Twitter Bootstrap,  Django-Crispy-Forms and Django-Allauth to allow users to sign up and run a test payment of 10$ on Stripe's servers. You can [check it out here](https://jonsonesen.pythonanywhere.com "django-example") once there you can sign up and click on the checkout option and submit a test payment using stripes test credentials. Created while following [this](https://www.udemy.com/learn-django-code-accept-payments-with-stripe/#/ "django-example") free tutorial . <BR>
